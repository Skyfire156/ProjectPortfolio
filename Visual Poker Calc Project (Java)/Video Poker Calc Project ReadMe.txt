 The Video Poker Calc project was a class assignment with the purpose of finding the optimal play for a hand of Video Poker. 

	The game of Video Poker described for this project was a hypothetical online poker game.  A player would buy into the game, paying a set amount to play a hand.  That player would then get a hand of cards, and would then decide which cards to keep and which cards to get rid of.  The discarded cards would then be replaced, and the resulting hand would be reviewed to see if it matched any of the predetermined winning poker hands. Different winning hands have different payout values, determined by the Payout Table published by the game.

	The Video Poker Calc program reads in a file which holds the values of the Payout Table for the Video Poker game, and finds the overall payout ratio of the game if every hand is played with its optimal strategy.  This process includes finding the optimal strategy for each possible starting hand, and tallying up how much the player stands to win in each resulting situation.  These tallies are then added together, and the result is the ratio for how much a player, playing perfectly, would expect to get for every unit of money they spend on playing the game.  

	The project was assigned to teach students how to think and program in an object oriented manner.  It was intended to have more features added on later on, but the nature of the initial project was such that it took most of the remaining time in the semester to finish, so some of the projected features are not implemented.  These features were things such as being able to actually play a round of Video Poker from a GUI, being able to pick a hypothetical hand of cards and see the optimal play, and being able to customize the winning hands the Poker game recognized.  Several of these features are partially implemented, but not finished.
