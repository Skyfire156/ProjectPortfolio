This application was developed individually in preparation for job hunting.  It uses Java and makes use of JavaFX for the gui.  It is a simple application so far, and still under development.  I created it for the purpose of extracting possible keywords from a job description in order to ensure as many of those as possible could be added to my resume, helping to get that resume nearer to the top of the pile.
