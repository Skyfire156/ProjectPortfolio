This ToDo list was created as a simple way of keeping track of my daily tasks/chores.  It's a work in progress, with several other features planned but not yet implemented.  The ToDo list uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create a webpage in which text can be entered as an item to be done.  Once created, a ToDo item can be checked off, deleted, or unchecked if it needs to be re-done.  Tasks are stored locally and persist between different sessions, useful as a reminder of what you didn't get done yesterday, etc.
