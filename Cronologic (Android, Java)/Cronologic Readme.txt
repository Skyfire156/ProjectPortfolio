Cronologic App ReadMe:

About:
	Cronologic is an app developed as a capstone project during my time at MSU Denver.  The app is designed to help with executive functioning in individuals with developmental disabilities.  It is designed to help such individuals keep track of their daily schedule, allowing them to input tasks to be done that day, alarms and appointments that need attention, and longer term projects that need work.  The app helps organize and keep all relevant information right at the user's fingertips, keeping them on track for the day.

	This app was created in Android Studio using Java.  The app also interfaces with Google Maps services for appointment locations and travel time notifications, and with Google's Firebase database to store information and share it between users on the same account.

	My part of the project dealt mainly with the Daily Tasks aspect of the app.  I was responsible for most things to do with this aspect, from creating the GUI to getting the Tasks to synchronize with the database, and everything in between.
