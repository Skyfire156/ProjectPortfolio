The Downtime app is a project I worked on independently as a means of keeping track of some information for a Pathfinder game I was playing in at the time.  Pathfinder has some optional rules to give players some interesting things to do during their character's downtime from adventuring.  These rules are extensive and require a lot of book keeping. I made this in an attempt to simplify that book keeping and streamline the process.  It turned out pretty well, but I didn't wind up using it for very long, as the campaign ended soon after I got the application working.  It still is a little rough, and has a few features missing, but I didn't keep working on developing it once the campaign was over, so it is probably as finished as it's going to be.
