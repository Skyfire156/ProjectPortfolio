The Remove Kth project was a class project assigned to give students practice with the classic programming challenge, the Josephus Problem.  The meat of the program is fairly simple, it takes the Kth item from a list and removes it, then repeats the process until the list is empty, returning the items from the list in the order in which they were removed.  The program was written to read data in from a file, use the read data to create a list, and then execute the Josephus cycle on it, writing the data into an output file as it goes for later validation.
