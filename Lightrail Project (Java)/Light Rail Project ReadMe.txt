The lightrail project was a class project I worked on with nearly a dozen classmates.  I helped with implementing some of the code, as well as ensuring the code measured up to standards.  The file I worked on primarily was PassengerArrivalFunction.java.  Most of the methods and algorithms in that file are my code, as well as smaller contributions to other parts of the project as a whole.
