This is a custom home page, holding all the links I use regularly in an easy to access manner, created for my own use as a way to learn some Javascript and CSS.  This version doesn't contain all the links I have on the one I regularly use, but a sample of some sites so that more can be added easily with the same template.  

This home page uses HTML for the basic structure, CSS for the look and most of the changes, and Javascript to get a few things done that couldn't be done with CSS alone, such as angling the links when they appear.

This project is unfinished in this state, I have a few other features I am planning on implementing, such as integrating the ToDo list which can be found in this project portfolio on GitHub.  This project will be updated when that happens.
