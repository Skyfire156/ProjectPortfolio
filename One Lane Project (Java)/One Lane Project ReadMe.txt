	The One Lane project was a project developed for a Programming Pragmatics class.  It was assigned in part to teach something about the process of the design and implementation of the Object Oriented software development paradigm.  It utilizes Apache Ant to build, test, and run the program, as well as create documentation.  All can be done with one command from the command line.  This automated building was another large part of the project, and learning how to use these types of build tools was another part of the reason for the project.

	The program itself simulates the movement of an arbitrary number of vehicles along a single lane road of arbitrary length, for a random amount of time.  The program then counts the number of 'clumps' that have developed as faster moving cars butt up against slower moving ones.  With this implementation, the number of clumps is usually equal to the number of cars, as a single car counts as a clump all by itself, and the arbitrary length of the road and start positions of the cars tend to put them far enough apart that they do not run into each other over the course of normal simulations.
